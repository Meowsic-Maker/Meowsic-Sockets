# Meowsic Maker

<img src='GamePreview.gif' alt='screenshot'>

Meowsic Maker is a web browser-based multi-player game for kids of all ages! Players can create an account, log in, and join friends to create custom meowsterpieces together in real time. Choose from six different kinds of cats, each with its own meowlody. Each cat appears at the click of a button from the menu, then drop it onto the stage to create cute meowsical combinations with the background track. Include at least one of each cat to hear the full song!
